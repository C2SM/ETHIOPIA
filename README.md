# Sirocco

Sirocco is a library for creating weather and climate workflows from a `yaml`
format inspired by [cylc](https://cylc.github.io/) and
[AiiDA](https://www.aiida.net/). It either runs standalone on the target cluster
or uses AiiDA running on a dedicated server as a workflow engine.

## Install
